# DarkRoom - MC

Darkroom - A Minecraft Adaption (WIP)

Minigame map adaption of the game DarkRoom


## What is This?

This is a side project of DarkRoom, a game developed by Group #16 in the class `Game Design and Programming 2019` of National Taiwan University.

The core game has its own private repository, this repository is dedicated for the Minecraft adaption only.


## Who is in Charge of This?

[Octupus Tea](https:/github.com/octupustea), the only Minecraft player in the team.


## Installation

The map has not been done yet.

However, if you insist, the game can be installed by the following step:

- Download a release and unzip, or `git clone` to get cheeck developing progress.

- Copy `DarkRoom-MC` directory to your Minecraft save directory

- Copy `[V5] DarkRoom-MC Resource Pack` directory to your Minecraft resource pack directory

- Open Minecraft, load in the resource pack, start the world and enjoy the game!

### Where is Minecraft Saves Directory? I Can't Find it!

Here are the default location where Minecraft stores data:
- Linux & MacOS: `$HOME/.minecraft` (`/home/<username>/.minecraft`)
- Windows: `%AppData%/.minecraft` (`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`)

Then you should see the directories of `saves`, `resourcepacks`, etc. If any of which doesn't exist, create a new directory.


## So... You Have Lots of Time Goofing Around, Aren't You?

*Well, yes, but actually no.* **Sweats nervously\**
